## Difference operators and GKLO homomorphism

This is a small code that realizes (localized) algebras of difference operators

## Usage

To use it, clone the repository:

```
	git clone https://github.com/art-kalm/gklo.git
```

Install `sage`, launch it, and run

```
	%attach DIRECTORY/difference_operators.py
```
for general difference operators and 
```
	%attach DIRECTORY/gklo.py
```
for GKLO difference operators (replacing DIRECTORY by the directory where you cloned the repo).

Examples of usage can be found in `examples.ipynb`. To open it, you can either launch `Sagemath Notebook` or run in the command line 
```
	sage -n
```
